Weekly Sales Calculation

This code will calculate your company's weekly sales based off of how much sales were made in one day. 
To do this, input a valid number for the sales input, and then the code will multiply that number by 7 to calculate the weekly sales.

python app.py
# or
python3 app.py

Example Output:
How much did we make in sales today? 700
If we make that each day, we'll make $ 4900 this week.
